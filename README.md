# Republic of Me

**Republic of Me** is a living digital archive of therapeutic mapping, emotional regulation, symbolic terrains, and narrative self-integration. It was created as a deeply personal project to visualize and interact with the complex inner world of memory, healing, attachment, and survival.

This site serves as both a symbolic map and a functional tool for exploring emotional states, self-regulation, and therapist-guided journeys. Every section is part of a layered system: the terrain of memory, the travelers who carry it, and the tools built to hold it safely.

This site is not a portfolio or blog.  
It is a **cartography of survival** — built not just to reflect but to regulate, to witness, and to help hold the truths that once had nowhere to land.
