    <h2>Terrain Overview</h2>
    <p>This soft terrain honors the lifelong fight for justice, equality, and protection of others. It represents the emotional and spiritual home of <strong>The Warrior for Others</strong> — the part who marched, legislated, advocated, and stood strong when others could not. Located in the Green Zone, it reflects a regulated state rooted in moral clarity, communal care, and principled action.</p>
